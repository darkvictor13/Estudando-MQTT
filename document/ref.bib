We used general additive mixed modelling, which allows for non-linear effects and an extensive soil temperature dataset (245,330 observations from 45 sites) from Australia to build the model. The model uses climatic and environmental data as inputs and had good predictive ability (mean cross-validated R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 1.91, percent bias = −0.01). The preceding day’s maximum temperature and temperature difference (daily maximum – minimum) were the two climate variables most strongly correlated with soil temperature. The model was used to develop a real-time web-based spatial decision support tool to inform cotton planting decisions. We also demonstrate the approaches utility for research, by hindcasting our model using high quality historical climate data and demonstrate significant shifts towards earlier (−11 days) and more variable (standard deviation + 3.16 days) planting windows relative to the origins of the Australian modern cotton industry in the 1960s.",

abstract = "In recent years, some official reports, to produce best products regarding quality, quantity and economic conditions, recommend that the farming sector should benefit with new tools and techniques coming from Information and Communications Technology (ICT) realm. In this way, during last decade the deployment of sensing devices has increased considerably in the field of agriculture. This fact has led to a new concept called smart agriculture, and it contemplates activities such as field monitoring, which offer support to make decisions or perform actions, such as irrigation or fertilization. Apart from sensing devices, which use the Internet protocol to transfer data (Internet of Things), there are the so-called crop models, which are able to provide added value over the data provided by the sensors, with the aim of providing recommendations to farmers in decision-making and thus, increase the quality and quantity of their production. In this scenario, the current work uses a low-cost sensorized platform, capable of monitoring meteorological phenomena following the Internet of Things paradigm, with the goal to apply an alert disease model on the cultivation of the vine. The edge computing paradigm is used to achieve this objective; also our work follows some advances from GIScience to increase interoperability. An example of this platform has been deployed in a vineyard parcel located in the municipality of Vilafamés (Castelló, Spain).",

abstract = "Summary This study evaluated the family of ECH2O sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) for measurement of soil moisture content (θ), bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) and temperature for a range of soils, across a range of measurement frequencies between 5 and 150MHz. Measurement frequency is one of the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to soil variables such as soil texture, electrical conductivity, and temperature. Measurements in both soil and solution demonstrated that the ECH2O EC and TE measurements were accurate. Using a measurement frequency of 70MHz, a single calibration curve was determined for a range of mineral soils, independent of soil salinity, suggesting there might be no need for a soil specific calibration. When combining all data for each soil type, the R2 values remained high (R2=0.98) with little probe to probe variability. After laboratory calibration, the error for θ was about 2%, independent of soil ECb, up to a soil solution EC of about 12dS/m. Our results showed that a single calibration curve could be used for all tested mineral soils, independent of soil salinity. The bulk soil ECb – water content data were excellently described by a polynomial expression. Measurements of temperature sensitivity to soil water content and ECb were sufficiently small. For example, for a temperature change of 10°C, measurements of θ and ECb were affected by about 0.02cm3cm−3 and 0.02dS/m, respectively. Limited sensor calibration requirements are important, when large networks of soil moisture sensors are being deployed. It is concluded that an accurate, cost-effective soil moisture sensor is available that operates at a measurement frequency of 70MHz, with a low sensitivity to confounding soil environmental factors.",

The “Internet of Things” (IoT) is a highly promising family of technologies which is capable of offering many solutions towards the modernisation of agriculture. Scientific groups and research institutions, as well as the industry, are in a race trying to deliver more and more IoT products to the agricultural business stakeholders, and, eventually, lay the foundations to have a clear role when IoT becomes a mainstream technology. At the same time Cloud Computing, which is already very popular, and Fog Computing provide sufficient resources and solutions to sustain, store and analyse the huge amounts of data generated by IoT devices. The management and analysis of IoT data (“Big Data”) can be used to automate processes, predict situations and improve many activities, even in real-time. Moreover, the concept of interoperability among heterogeneous devices inspired the creation of the appropriate tools, with which new applications and services can be created and give an added value to the data flows produced at the edge of the network. The agricultural sector was highly affected by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies and is expected to be equally benefited by the IoT. In this article, a survey of recent IoT technologies, their current penetration in the agricultural sector, their potential value for future farmers and the challenges that IoT faces towards its propagation is presented.",

Plants are sessile organisms and are affected by biotic and abiotic stresses caused due to surrounding environmental conditions such as soil water content, pest/disease infestation, and soil health. High-resolution sensing (Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) Systems) of agro-meteorological parameters helps to solve critical issues about the crop-weather-soil continuum. Currently, many WSN systems are deployed all over the World for precision agriculture purposes. Although there have been many improvements in the communication aspects of the WSN's, the data dissemination and near real-time analysis components for taking dynamic decision, particularly in agriculture domain has not matured. The current WSN systems do not have a standardized way of data discovery, access, and sharing, which impedes the integration of data across various distributed sensor networks. This study addresses above issues through the adaptation of a framework based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards for Sensor Web Enablement (SWE). For precision agriculture applications a cost-effective, standardized sensing system (hardware and software) has been developed, which includes functionalities such as sensors plug-n-play, remote monitoring, tools for crop water requirement estimation, pest, disease monitoring, and nutrient management. Also, the modeling techniques were integrated with the interoperable web-enabled sensing system for addressing water management problems of horticultural crops in semi-arid areas.",

abstract = "Over the last few years, an extensive set of technologies have been systematically included in precision agriculture (PA) and also in precision viticulture (PV) practices, as tools that allow efficient monitoring of nearly any parameter to achieve sustainable crop management practices and to increase both crop yield and quality. However, many technologies and standards are not yet included on those practices. Therefore, potential benefits that may result from putting together agronomic knowledge with electronics and computer technologies are still not fully accomplished. Both emergent and established paradigms, such as the Internet of Everything (IoE), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud and fog computing, together with increasingly cheaper computing technologies – with very low power requirements and a diversity of wireless technologies, available to exchange data with increased efficiency – and intelligent systems, have evolved to a level where it is virtually possible to expeditiously create and deploy any required monitoring solution. Pushed by all of these technological trends and recent developments, data integration has emerged as the layer between crops and knowledge needed to efficiently manage it. In this paper, the mySense environment is presented, aimed to systematize data acquisition procedures to address common PA/PV issues. mySense builds over a 4-layer technological structure: sensor and sensor nodes, crop field and sensor networks, cloud services and support to front-end applications. It makes available a set of free tools based on the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) concept and enables the use of Arduino® and Raspberry Pi (RPi) low-cost platforms to quickly prototype a complete monitoring application. Field experiments provide compelling evidences that mySense environment represents an important step forward towards Smart Farming, by enabling the use of low-cost, fast deployment, integrated and transparent technologies to increase PA/PV monitoring applications adoption.",

abstract = "A precise and continuous in-situ monitoring of bio-physical crop parameters is crucial for the efficiency and sustainability in modern agriculture. The leaf area index (LAI) is an important key parameter allowing to derive vital crop information. As it serves as a valuable indicator for yield-limiting processes, it contributes to situational awareness ranging from agricultural optimization to global economy. This paper presents a feasible, robust, and low-cost modification of commercial off-the-shelf photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) sensors, which significantly enhances the potential of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technology for non-destructive in-situ LAI assessment. In order to minimize environmental influences such as direct solar radiation and scattering effects, we upgrade such a sensor with a specific diffuser combined with an appropriate optical band-pass filter. We propose an implementation of a distributed WSN application based on a simplified model of light transmittance through the canopy and validate our approach in various field campaigns exemplarily conducted in maize cultivars. Since a ground truth LAI is very difficult to obtain, we use the LAI-2200, one of the most widely established standard instruments, as a reference. We evaluate the accuracy of LAI estimates derived from the analysis of PAR sensor data and the robustness of our sensor modification. As a result, an extensive comparative analysis emphasizes a strong linear correlation (r2=0.88, RMSE=0.28) between both approaches. Hence, the proposed WSN-based approach enables a promising alternative for a flexible and continuous LAI monitoring.",

Obtaining real-time non-invasive information to monitor crops or make yield predictions is a challenge. An approach is to use crop yield models in combination with real-time data used as input in such models. It was demonstrated that it is possible to design an accurate system using open source hardware and open systems to record the input for these models and monitor crops. The system presented has two main components: a device that records environmental parameters and a smartphone application (software) that links this device to a data server in order to process and analyse the information. The solution is scalable in terms of the type of sensors used (i.e. temperature and relative humidity of the air or soil), the rate of information retrieval and so on, so it can be used in various scenarios, including environmental or land policy monitoring. Moreover, this open source hardware can be used by a broad variety of users and is an alternative in poor rural areas because of its low cost compared to other solutions. It can enable increased agricultural production and management of the local environment, bringing new agricultural practices to these areas. Furthermore, progress in the use of this type of technology can help to develop new capabilities for growers.

The literature on soil moisture is very extensive and is developing so rapidly that it might be considered ambitious to seek to present the state of the art concerning research into this key variable. Even when covering investigations about only one aspect of the problem, there is a risk of some inevitable omission. A specific feature of the present essay, which may make this overview if not comprehensive at least of particular interest, is that the reader is guided through the various traditional and more up-to-date methods by the central thread of techniques developed to measure soil moisture interwoven with applications of modeling tools that exploit the observed datasets. This paper restricts its analysis to the evolution of soil moisture at the local (spatial) scale. Though a somewhat loosely defined term, it is linked here to a characteristic length of the soil volume investigated by the soil moisture sensing probe. After presenting the most common concepts and definitions about the amount of water stored in a certain volume of soil close to the land surface, this paper proceeds to review ground-based methods for monitoring soil moisture and evaluates modeling tools for the analysis of the gathered information in various applications. Concluding remarks address questions of monitoring and modeling of soil moisture at scales larger than the local scale with the related issue of data aggregation. An extensive, but not exhaustive, list of references is provided, enabling the reader to gain further insights into this subject.",

abstract = "Limited water supplies in arid regions put constraints on agriculture. In arid New Mexico, greenhouse chile pepper production has the potential for water and nutrient savings. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare two capacitance sensors – (Hydra probes and 5TM) and one TDR CS616 sensor, (2) compute actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for drip-irrigated chile peppers for three water treatments, and (3) develop new crop coefficients (Kc) for the three growing seasons in a greenhouse study. Three water treatments were (1) control where water was applied near the surface using two drip emitters, (2) partial root zone drying vertical (PRDv) where subsurface irrigation was applied at 20cm depth from soil surface, and (3) partial root zone drying compartment (PRDc) where roots were divided into two compartments and irrigation were switched between compartments after 15days. Sensor-generated volumetric water contents (θ) were correlated with the gravimetrically determined θ, and the new calibration coefficients improved the precision of θ estimates. From 2011 onward, irrigation amounts were adjusted to minimize deep percolation, and about 30% less water was applied in 2014 as compared to the 2011 growing season but no significant differences were observed in transpiration rate and leaf temperature. The ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca) was significantly correlated to transpiration rate and vapor pressure deficit in 2014 (P<0.05). ETa obtained from water balance and reference ET (ETr) from Penman-Monteith developed the Kc for drip-irrigated greenhouse chile peppers for three growing seasons. The maximum values of Kc were about 1.4 during 2013 and 1.2 during 2014. The 2011 growing season was shorter and the maximum Kc were closer to one. Crop coefficients for greenhouse grown chile peppers varied with growing seasons and irrigation treatment. Irrigation scheduling can be done based on the soil moisture or Kc for the known growing season. This study demonstrated the water saving potential of PRD.",

abstract = "The quality of grapes and the drying process has a momentous impact on the quality of the final products (raisins). South Azerbaijan is the most important region for grape growing and raisin producing. However, the majority of the vineyards in the region are traditional, and the drying process is carried out in conventional structures that are not convenient. To increase the quality and productivity, it is necessary to modernize agricultural practices with reasonable cost suitable and affordable to traditional farming and farmers. To do this, the harsh environments and severe climate conditions of the vineyards and the drying buildings should be observed periodically to collect data. Wireless Sensor Networks are a key technology that can provide precise information, can update information, and can be a valuable resource to farmers to determine appropriate management practices. Using this technology, farmers can make real-time decisions such as scheduling irrigation periods, preventing diseases, choosing the right time for harvesting and so on. In this project, a Wireless Sensor Network system was designed and developed for remote real-time monitoring and collection of micrometeorological parameter data in three distant vineyards. The system was also used for monitoring the SO2 gas fumigation process and atmospheric parameters inside the drying structure. The system consists of a gateway and a series of peripheral wireless motes placed in the vineyards and inside the drying structure, which are equipped with agrometeorological sensors for environmental monitoring and for storing and transmitting data to the gateway. The gateway collects agrometeorological data and utilizes a wireless technology for data transmission and for communication between the motes and the central server (webpage). In addition, an on-line (real-time) warning system was embedded in the gateway to send alarm signals via SMS (Short Message Service). The devices were tested for software configuration functionality, hardware operation and data acquisition, energy consumption, and connectivity. Field experiment results demonstrated that the system represents a complete monitoring system, which provides efficient performance for developing information systems in precision viticulture.",
